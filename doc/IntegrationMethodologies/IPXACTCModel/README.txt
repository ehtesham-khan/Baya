Objective of this example is to show howto to import IP-XACT Design and 
associated components in the DesignPlayer framework. Then modify the
loaded database and dump out the C model of the entire design corresponding
to the REGISTER database

Also, dumpout the Verilog view of the design for rest of the design 
implementation flow

Execute the below command to try out this example-

designplayer-shell -f designplayer_commands.tcl

If you review the generated log file, you will find couple of Errors which are
valid to give you an idea that it catches errors deep in the referred bus
interfaces
